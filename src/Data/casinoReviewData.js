      "Here’s a preview of the main things we look for when researching an online casino review. To have the best insight into these casinos, we not only sign up and deposit at the online casinos, but we also read forums and user reviews alongside other expert reviews. This helps us get a full picture of the sites, so we can offer our players the most accurate information.",
    criteria_list: [
      {
        title: "Security & licenses",
        details:
          "Making sure the online casinos you play at are safe and legal is one of the most important aspects of our review process. We check that sites have legitimate, independent licenses from top regulators and industry bodies. These organisations vary depending on where you’re playing, but all casinos we recommend have the relevant certifications. This ensures they meet standards for fair gameplay, using things like Random Number Generators."

      {
        title: "Bonuses & promotions",
        details:
          "Big welcome bonuses are obviously appealing, but we carefully check the small print to see if an offer is as good as it seems. Generous casino bonuses with low wagering requirements and enough time to fulfill the offer are the gold standard. We also like to see regular promotions for all players, and a VIP scheme for loyal customers."

        title: "Games & software",
        details:
          "We always test a casino's game selection ourselves with real money, to get a true feel for it. We're looking for a good variety of real money and free play titles from top software developers, huge progressive jackpots and the option to download."
      },
      {
        title: "Banking & payment methods",
        details:
          "A range of secure banking options is essential, and both the deposit and withdrawal processes should be quick and easy, with minimal processing time. Increasingly, we like to see eWallet and cryptocurrency options available to players for fast, safe withdrawals. RTP (return to player) rates should be anywhere from around 94% and up."
      },
      {
        title: "Customer support",
        details:
          "Although you hopefully won't need it, good customer support options should be easy to access with at least one way to contact the casino 24/7. The best casinos offer email, live chat and telephone help, but we would also expect to see FAQs and help forums for more general issues. Casinos should also honor data protection agreements and consider the wellbeing of their customers."
